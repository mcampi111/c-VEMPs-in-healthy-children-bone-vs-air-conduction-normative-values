R code for data analysis of the paper named Cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (c-VEMPs) in healthy children: bone vs air conduction normative values. The paper is available at this link https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2023.1157975/full 



## ABSTRACT  
Objectives: Cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (c-VEMPs) are feasible and reliable electrophysiological measures that are widely used in adults for evaluating the otolith vestibulospinal function. In children, normative values are still lacking. The objectives of the present study were to characterize bone conduction (BC) and air conduction (AC) c-VEMPs in healthy children, compare them to adults and to test for possible age- and gender-related changes.
